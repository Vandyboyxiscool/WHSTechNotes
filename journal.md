  Computer Science contribes to Aviation safety through software and information systems. Computer Science in used to gather data and help prevent crashes like the one described. This kind of machine learning can minimize the effort needed to predict weather outcomes and help design succesful flight paths. Certain code can quickly asses concerns and hazards on  flight, all while the pilot focuses on operations.
 
  Another factor of Avition Safety is A.I. A.I. is often used in the terms of auto pilot. The Plane can optimize the flitght pattern while maintaing the plane's speed. All of this can be done with minimal human intervention, allowing pilots to spend more time on comms. Since Pilots may have more time to focus on all aspects of a plane, flights can be safer.

I would say that the most interesting thing I learned last week was how to accuratley make text follow someones face in a video. 
I learned this bny watching some tutorials on youtube. I later used this knowledge to make a new video edit to post on my social media.
This was so interesting to me because it is something I had wanted to learn for a while.

Slang use in youth is an important part of exspressing emotion and ideas. When children talk using slang, educators, or adults who work in an environment with children may not understand exactly what they are communicating. Sometimes the slang will be understood, but the adult will not understand the weight a term carries. It is important for adults to understand slang because if not, the gap between children and adults can be increased to a level where kids will not want to communicate how they feel to adults, as the adults may not understand. 
 ("\n")          Technology plays a big part in slang use even before innovative action because social media is how slang is spread between the youth. Because of this, one way people working with children can become in tune with children is by paying attention to language used on sites like Tiktok and Instagram. Another way technology can be used to improve the issue of misconuication is through Artifical Intelligence. Artificial Intelligence, or A.I. can be used to scan the internet for information; moreover, it can be used as an advanced search engine. As A.I. grows to be smarter, it is getting better at understanding questions, even those about the slang used by the youth. If there is ever a word that an adult is unsure of, they can simply use A.I. to grow their vocabulary in a way that cannot be replicated by traditional means.

Over the break technology was my main passtime. I spent most of my days playing video games like Mortal Kombat and Roblox. When I wasn't playing games, I was catching up on the Harley Quinn show, or my favorite youtuber's videos. I was at home relaxing for a lot of the break, and some of that included using massage aid technology. 
("\n")
I did not spend my whole break at home. I went out to the arcade with my family and of course that included technology. There were times I went to eat out and used electronic menus. Even when I went to Natural Bridge Caverns, the most nature filled experience, I used technology to record videos of the animals. It seems like every step of my break I used technology, and I start to wonder when it becomes too much.

I beleive "March Madness" is an engaging event for all sports fans. The use of technology like AR can enhance the experience for many. With the help of AR, a fan can be immersed in the game, as if they were in the stadium. ("n") Part of what makes "March Madness" such an exciting event is the predictions of who will win. When someone is supporting a team, they are compelled to watch their matches and root for them from afar. Aside from supporting your favorite team, people also make predictions for gambling purposes, or maybe just to compete with friends. When A.I. is used to make predictions on who will win, it ruins the experience. Since making predictions is such a big part of the event, when people use A.I., it takes away the fun. Technology can impact "March Madness" in both good and bad ways; furthermore, it is up to each individual to decide how they approach technology, so that they can make an experience that is enjoyable for them.
